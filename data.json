    "problemStatement": "The Master's Assistance Center has announced an entrance exam, which consists of the following. The candidate is given a set s of size n and some strange integer c . For this set, it is needed to calculate the number of pairs of integers (x,y) such that 0\u2264x\u2264y\u2264c , x+y is not contained in the set s , and also y\u2212x is not contained in the set s . Your friend wants to enter the Center. Help him pass the exam!",
    "input": "Input Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t ( 1\u2264t\u22642\u22c5 10 4 ) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers n and c ( 1\u2264n\u22643\u22c5 10 5 , 1\u2264c\u2264 10 9 ) \u2014 the size of the set and the strange integer. The second line of each test case contains n integers s 1 , s 2 ,\u2026, s n ( 0\u2264 s 1 < s 2 <\u2026< s n \u2264c ) \u2014 the elements of the set s . It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3\u22c5 10 5 .",
